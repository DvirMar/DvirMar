Hi, I’m Dvir Bar Martziano. 
I’m interested in FrontEnd developing and React.
I’m a B.SC. computer science student in the Open University of Israel. 
I've also completed React in UDEMY courses and I am showing some of my knowledge in the projects I have uploaded. I'm always open for constructive criticism. You can contact me by email: Dvirma1996@gmail.com
